# mobx

## things left

- [x] introduce mobX
- [x] wire up all the actions
  - [x] update name
  - [x] update total
  - [x] add split
  - [x] change name onEnterPressed/onBlur
  - [x] allow number to be nothing
  - [x] delete categories
  - [x] add category
  - [x] add support for @decorators
  - [x] reset balances
  - [x] delete category
  - ~~[ ] button: re-add total category if all categories have been deleted~~
    - not needed. Deletion is only allowed when current category is part of another's sub-category
    - the other strategy would be to switch the store to be a `Array<Category>`, instead of starting at just `Category`
- [ ] bugs
  - [ ] able to enter `023` instead of a valid number
- [ ] improvements
  - [x] shift concept of the "Total" category, instead have the store be a list of categories?
  - ~~[ ] make total field editable like name (doubleClick and submit onEnter or onBlur)~~
    - it might be difficult for the user to know what's editable values and what's computed
  - [ ] use Math library for financial calculations
    - b/c in javascript: `1.1 + 0.3 = 1.4000000000000001`
  - [ ] verify that all `observer`s are actually needed
    - this was sprinkled liberally to get things working and the docs said there was no downside (https://mobx.js.org/refguide/observer-component.html -> Characteristics of observer components -> "you cannot under-subscribe or over-subscribe")
  - [ ] pass the store around with context?
    - might not be needed b/c it seems that every level requires an action or prop off of category
  - [ ] switch to mobx-state-tree

  - [ ] import?
- [ ] styling
  - [ ] subCategories (indenting)
  - [ ] buttons
- [ ] deploy
  - github actions vs travis vs CircleCI
